# My-i3-configs
#Arch linux i3wm desktop with i3blocks.  Font-Awsome needs to be installed for i3blocks bar.  Set mod+shift+z kill current window. (easier to press).  Converted system temperature from C to F.  Updates once a second. Used to have qutebrowser as default web browser but frequent crashes and poor logging forced me to go back to Brave.
